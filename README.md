DSA: Analysis and Design

Throughout this course, I learned about different data structures, their strengths and weaknesses,
and how to evaluate their efficiency. The problem that needed to be solved for this project was to evaluate
different data structures and recommend one that would best fit the needs of the project. The code needed to
read items in from a CSV file, create a data structure of objects, and search and sort the data structure.
Between vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees, a hash table best suited the needs of this project.
There were a few things I needed to brush up on, like pointers, references, and a good hash function, but
nothing that StackOverflow and Google couldn't help guide me in. This project really helped me understand the
importance of efficiency and memory management, and allowed me to explore different storing and sorting solutions.
